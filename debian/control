Description: Hcron event scheduling tool
 Hcron does provides a similar service to the regular cron with
 the addition of:
 - event definition management is simplified:
   - events are stored, 1 per file
   - event definitions are set according to name=value settings
   - events may be hierarchically organized under directories within
     the filesystem
 - optional email notification may be sent after executing the action
   associated with an event
 - an event may be associated with a host onto which the event action
   is executed; a non-local host may be required, according the
   configuration
