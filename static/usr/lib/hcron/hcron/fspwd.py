    a missing/non-answering service show up a a KeyError, we need a
    way to differentiate between to two. Thus, the test_net_username
    which is a known network username and should always return a valid
    response if the service is working properly. The expectation is
    that the time between calls to pwd.getpwnam for the given name and
    the test name is virtually 0, so that we can confidently say whether
    a failure is service related or a real, non-existent user error.
